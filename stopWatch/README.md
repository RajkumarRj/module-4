This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionalities.

**HTML (index.html):**
- The HTML document defines the structure of the stopwatch with a timer display and three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset.

**JavaScript (index.js):**
- The JavaScript code handles the logic of the stopwatch.
- It uses `setInterval` to update the elapsed time every 10 milliseconds and formats the time using the `formatTime` function.
- The `startTimer` function initializes the timer, the `stopTimer` function stops the timer, and the `resetTimer` function resets the timer.
- Event listeners are added to the Start, Stop, and Reset buttons to trigger the corresponding functions.

**CSS (style.css):**
- The CSS styles define the appearance of the stopwatch, including font size, color, button styles, and responsiveness.
